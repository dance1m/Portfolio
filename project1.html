<section class="two">
	<p>I started with the idea of having a motor mounted offset inside of the base. The motor would have 1 gear attached, would mesh with a gear that lined the inside of a rotating plate, and be mounted by 2 brackets using brass heat inserts. I then would need to design a bearing that the plate could spin on.</p>
</section>
<section class="two">
	<p>I decided to go with a compression style bearing to support the weight of the entire arm instead of your typical axial bearing. This is because axial bearings are not designed to hold a load or force along the axis of rotation and could spontaneously disassemble itself. To test tolerances and proof of concept, I decided to make a smaller version to decrease print times. The blue arrows represent the direction of force that would be applied to the ball bearing.</p>

<section class="two">
	<p>I then designed and printed the main bearing which was about 20 hours of printing combined between the 4 parts. There are 2 inner components and 2 outer components. The bottom inside component with the gear is taller then the top and does not meet in the middle to give space so I could fill the first side with ball bearings without them falling out when I fill the second side. The 4 channels that go around the center are where the balls are suppose to sit.</p>
</section>
<section class="two">
	<p>The idea was to have the motor directly drive the gear on the inside of the main bearing at a 5:1 gear ratio. Since larger gear ratios to provide more torque require more space, I designed that 5:1 gear ratio to keep the teeth thick enough to not strip and the size of the overall base around 180mm. The motor has .33 ft lb of torque, with the gear ratio it would be increased to 1.65 ft lb. I put it all together and when I put my hand on top of the spinning plate, it stopped with no resistance. Right then and there I realized that I was going to have to redesign the entire inside.</p>

	<p>Since I did not want to make the project bigger, I knew I would have to design an entire gear train to fit inside the existing space. The base took around 26 hours to print, longer prints have a higher chance of printing failures, and the base I printed first came out perfect. I wanted to retrofit what I already had, and reprint the least amount of things possible. To get larger gear ratios inside the same space, I would need to take advantage of compound gear trains. That is when the connecting gear between 2 gear reductions are connected together, side by side. The picture on the right is an example of one. </p>

<section class="two">
	<p>With more torque in a larger gear reduction, having the motor sit offset could lead to the motor being forced apart and twisting in ways it shouldnt. For this reason, I chose to go with a planetary gear train. This would allow me to put the motor in the center and use 3 gears evenly distributed around the gear the motor drives to apply the torque evenly. The image to the left shows the central gear that the motor drives (sun gear), the 3 transitional gears around that (planet gears), and the inner ring gear around the outside. This completes 1 of the 2 gear reductions.  </p>
</section>
<section class="two">
    <p>In order to retrofit the base and center the motor, I had to design a plate that would use the existing motor mount heat insert screw holes (the 4 small holes seen on the bottom plate) to attach to the bottom of the base. The motor would then sit inside that space. I would need pillars to support the planet gears and a bracket to hold it all together in the same plane.</p>

<section class="two">
	<p>Since there are a lot of contact points, you dont want the gears to mesh too tightly and take away from the available torque, or mesh too loosely and introduce play into the system. To get this tolerance right without printing full size gears that take longer to print, I chose to print very thin planetary gear trains to test this fitment. </p>
</section>
<section class="two">
    <p>Now with the first set of planetary gears done, I just needed design the connecting gear that would mesh from the outside of the 1st set of gears, to the inside of the 2nd set of gears. I printed this in 2 pieces for a faster, cleaner print. The holes are for heat inserts and screws. I made the part transparent so you could see the teeth on the inner ring gear that would not have been visible. </p>

<section class="two">
<p>I then designed the bracket for the second set of gears to sandwich in between the walls of the base and the main bearing. That way it would screw together without requiring more heat inserts and screws. I used the same process as the first planetary gear train for the second, printing thin gears to test fitment and then printing the actual parts. The left image shows the bracket holding the second set of gears, layered on top of the first set.</p>

	<p>I could now screw down the main bearing to the top of the base, sandwiching the 2nd gear train bracket, and see how well the final product spins. This entire compound planetary gear train took about 50-100 hours to design, print, test, print, test, print etc. and involved a lot of changes in dimensions in the software to fit well in the assembly. Finally, I test to see how the torque felt now and it managed to spin with me standing on top of it. Now, I was 150lbs and standing directly on top which is not apples to apples considering the arm is projected to be 3 feet long, torque is force x radius. This means the further away the weight is, the more torque is required. It was still a massive success to see the bearing hold my weight no problem.</p>

<section class="two">
	<p>I went and designed the same thing for the next joint before deciding to scrap that idea and use worm gears. One reason I decided to go this route is simplicity, but the main reason was fail-safe. I need some way to stop the arm from falling when power is cut. Since worm gears spin in 2 different axis, when the worm gear stops spinning, it rests upon the spur gear like a shelf.</p>

<section class="two">
	<p>This is the point of the project I am currently working on. One issue I am having is the set screws that holds the spur gear on the axle, and stops it from spinning continues to come loose. I need to try loctite and see if that helps. If loctite does not work, I could order a larger diameter axle with new gears, but the gears and axle were $50 and I do not want to spend the money if I do not have to.</p>
</section>
<section class="two">
	<p>I could not find an axle with a D shape profile in the diameter I needed that was not extremely expensive or custom ordered, so I wound up using a dremel to flatten the ends and middle down for the set screws to have something to grip. </p>

<section class="two">
	<p>This was a test video of the 2nd axis. One problem I have is it will indeed self destruct, if the code lets it, by driving itself into the base and continuously trying to spin around, even though it only has 200 degrees of available rotation. Currently I watch and cut power when it moves too far. </p>
