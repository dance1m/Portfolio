    <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>I did HVAC over the summer with my dad  during my teen years. 2014-2016 I worked at a rollerskating rink during the weekends. After highschool I went to Penn State where I did 4 years and still have 1 more left to graduate. I am an all or nothing kind of person. When I pick up hobbies its the only thing I want to do, and when I have free time I can be found researching and studying that hobby. </p>

   <h3>Hobbies and Skills</h3>
      <p>I learned how to play piano in highschool, and guitar off and on over the last 15 years. I took 4 years of japanese in highschool, forgot most of it, then self taught myself the kanji for around 1,000 vocab terms (all of N5 and N4). I spent a few months getting good at yoyoing and solving rubix cubes. I ended up getting my average 3x3 rubix cube solve time down to 1:15s by learning around 21 different algorithms. I currently spend most of my free time working on my 5-axis robotic arm and playing videogames with friends.</p>
